Question: As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named anita requires access for a limited duration. 
To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:
Create a user named anita on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-02-17, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

ANS:
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh tony@stapp01
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo su
[root@stapp01 tony]# useradd anita
[root@stapp01 tony]# id anita
uid=1002(anita) gid=1002(anita) groups=1002(anita)
[root@stapp01 tony]# chage -E 2024-02-17 anita
[root@stapp01 tony]# chage -l anita
